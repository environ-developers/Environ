# Compilation instructions for Environ module

    This distribution of the Environ module is intended for Quantum ESPRESSO.
    The steps below will cover the following:

    - configuration of QE and Environ
    - QE compilation
    - Environ compilation
    - QE patching, dependency updating, and recompilation

    Note that Environ now uses its own FFTXlib and UtilXlib libraries modeled
    respectively after the FFTXlib and UtilXlib libraries of QE 6.7

    If there are any problems with the QE compilation step, look for solutions
    on the PW-forum, or refer to the Quantum ESPRESSO documentation and/or website:

      http://www.quantum-espresso.org/

# QE + Environ 3.1 Installation

    The following instructions refer to Environ 3.0 installed on QE >= 7.1
    For previous versions, please refer to the instructions on the website:

      https://environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/install.html

#

From Environ root:

1. configure Environ with

   - `./configure --with-qe=<absolute_path_to_QE>`
   - the script will attempt to find the necessary libraries/compilers
     - if it fails, the user may need to manually modify `make.inc`

2. compile Environ with

   - `make -jN compile`
   - `N` = number of cores for compilation (default = 1)
     - if issues arise, retry with `N` = 1

#

From QE root:

# using make

1. configure QE with

   - `./configure --with-environ=<absolute_path_to_Environ>`
   - the script will attempt to find the necessary libraries/compilers
     - if it fails, the user may need to manually modify `make.inc`

2. compile desired QE package with

   - `make -jN <package>`
   - `N` = number of cores for compilation (default = 1)
     - if issues arise, retry with `N = 1`
   - Environ supports the following QE packages: PW, CP, TDDFPT, XSpectra, NEB

# using cmake

1. create and navigate to a new directory (`build/` is a common choice)
2. generate build environment with

   - `cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=<...> -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<...> -DENVIRON_ROOT=<absolute_path_to_Environ> ..`
   - more information can be found at https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e/-/wikis/Developers/CMake-build-system

3. compile desired QE package as described above

#

If using cmake, modify the ESPRESSO_ROOT variable in the following files to reflect the build dir:

- Environ/tests/environment
- Environ/examples/qe/environment

#

# Uninstall Environ 3.1

From Environ root:

- `make clean`

- (OPTIONAL) `make veryclean` to also remove configuration files
