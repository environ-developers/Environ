            as gaussians of fixed spread, as specified by atomicspread(ityp) for each atomic type.
            Results are identical to using point-like charges (as is usually done in PW), unless the gaussian
            spreads are too large. The default value of 0.5 a.u. was derived to be safe enough in most

            Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 145501 (2005). This contribution can also be used as a simplified
            approach to more complex and general non-electrostatic contributions to solvation,
            as in the SCCS approach. In this second case, env_pressure needs not correspond to the

            http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/numerical-methods/numerical-derivative/smooth-low-noise-differentiators

            Each scheme can exploit different numbers of points of the real-space grid (as defined by nfdpoint).

            ifdtype .EQ. 5 : Smooth noise-robust (n=4)

            Central differences are used by default and have been tested more deeply. The other schemes

            e.g. ifdtype.EQ.1 .AND. nfdpoint.EQ.1 correspond to central differences with three points

            IMPORTANT: nfdpoint .EQ. 1 seems to be enough for most applications, but more refined
