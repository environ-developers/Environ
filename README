This is the distribution of the ENVIRON module for Quantum ESPRESSO.
These are the steps to compile Quantum ESPRESSO with the Environ module,
for more information on installation and usage of the module, please
check the web site http://www.quantum-environment.org/

The installation procedure assumes that the Environ directory has been
placed in the main Quantum ESPRESSO directory. All the installation steps
need to be performed from the main Quantum ESPRESSO directory.

Preliminary steps:

   -1) configure QE following the standard procedure, running
          ./configure 
       should be enough in most cases.
    0) compile QE without the Environ module, e.g. running
          make pw

If there are problems with the preliminary steps, look up for solutions
on the PW-forum or refer to the Quantum ESPRESSO documentation and web site
http://www.quantum-espresso.org/

    1) run the QE script addonpatch.sh with the -patch option
          ./install/addsonpatch.sh Environ Environ/src Modules -patch
    2) run the Environ installation script with the -patch option
          ./Environ/patches/environpatch.sh -patch
    3) run the QE script to regenerate modules' dependencies
          ./install/makedeps.sh
    4) re-compile, e.g.
          make pw
    5) run executables with -environ flag, e.g.
          pw.x -environ < pw.in > pw.out

To clean up the compilation with Environ follow these steps:

    1) run the QE script addsonpatch.sh with the -revert option
          ./install/addsonpatch.sh Environ Environ/src Modules -revert
    2) run the Environ installation script with the -revert option
          ./Environ/patches/environpatch.sh -revert
    3) run the QE script to regenerate modules' dependencies
          ./install/makedeps.sh
    4) be sure to remove objects, modules and executables
          make clean

The above instructions refer to Environ v1.0 installed on QE-6.3 and later versions
For previous versions of QE (namely QE-6.1.X and QE-6.2.X) please refer to the 
instructions on the website:

http://www.quantum-environment.org/installation.html

Also, when compiling codes different from pw.x, depending on the compiler it is 
possible to get an error related to missing dependencies. The error can be easily 
fixed by modifying by hand the relative Makefiles, instructions are reported online:
