example01: pw.x 
           calculation of total solvation free energy of an isolated molecule 
           including electrostatic/cavitation/PV contributions
example02: pw.x 
           use of different periodic boundary correction schemes for charged isolated systems
	   in vacuum and in solution: Martyna-Tuckerman or Point-Counter-Charge (parabolic)
example03: pw.x 
           use of parabolic correction for periodic boundary conditions in 
           neutral and charged 2D systems (slab)
example04: pw.x
           use of external classical charge distribution (planar) to model Helmholtz layer 
	   above a charged 2D system
example05: pw.x turbo_lanczos.x 
           calculation of the optical spectrum of a molecule in vacuum and in solution (only dielectric)
example06: pw.x turbo_davidson.x
	   calculation of the optical spectrum of a molecule in vacuum and in solution (only dielectric)
example07: cp.x (only for QE-5.3.0 and later versions)
	   calculation of the total solvation free energy of an isolated molecule
           including electrostatic/cavitation/PV contributions
example08: pw.x
           same as example01, but using a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm for the 
	   electrostatic contribution
