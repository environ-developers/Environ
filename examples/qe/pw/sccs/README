This example shows how to use pw.x to calculate the solvation energy
and other related solvation quantities for a water molecule in a water solvent.

The calculation is a standard geometry relaxation calculation,
but in the presence of a continuum dielectric with the shape defined
by the electronic density, according to the  model of Fattebert 
and Gygi, Int J Quantum Chem 93, 139 (2003), revised by O. Andreussi, I. Dabo 
and N. Marzari, J. Chem. Phys. 136, 064102 (2012) 

Mind that the parabolic correction (or point-countercharge method)
is used for both the calculation in vacuum and in the solvent.

Additional terms of solvation can be computed by changing the specific keywords:
-- env_surface_tension: surface tension of the solvent. If different from zero,  
   a cavitation energy is computed according to a revised version of the formula in 
   Scherlis et al. JCP 124, 074103, 2006 and Andreussi et al. J. Chem. Phys. 2012. 
-- env_pressure: external pressure of the medium. If different from zero, a PV
   energy term is added to the total energy, according to the method in 
   Cococcioni et al. PRL 94, 145501, 2005.

Two calculations illustrate how the self consistent dielectric can be
equivalently obtained either through an iterative procedure that solves 
for the polarization charge density or a preconditioned conjugate gradient 
algorithm that solves for the polarization potential (now the default, 
see G. Fisicaro, L. Genovese, O. Andreussi, N. Marzari and S. Goedecker,
J. Chem. Phys. 144, 014103 (2016))

A rough explanation of the different keywords of the solvation model is
